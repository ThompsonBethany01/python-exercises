# # Loop Basics

# ### While

# Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.

# In[1]:


#sets varialbe to i
i = 5


# Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15. Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.
# Your output should look like this:
# 
# 
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
# 11
# 12
# 13
# 14
# 15

# In[2]:

print('Question 4')
print('This code counts from i to 15. i = 5.')
#prints i while less than 16, adds one per loop
while i <= 15:
    print(i)
    i += 1


# Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.

# In[2]:

print('Question 5')
print('This code counts from 0 to 100 by 2s.')
#starts count at 0
count = 0

#counts up to 100
while count <= 100:
    print(count)
    #increments by 2
    count += 2


# Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.

# In[3]:

print('Question 6')
print('This code counts from 100 to -10 by 5s.')
#starts count at 100
count = 100

#ends count at -10
while count >= -10:
    print(count)
    #increments down by 5
    count += -5


# Create a while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 1,000,000. Output should equal:
# 
#  2
#  4
#  16
#  256
#  65536

# In[12]:

print('Question 7')
print('This code starts at 2, displays the number squared that is less than 1,000,000, and increments by this number.')
#starts loop at 2
x = 2

#conditional so value is less than 1,000,000
while x < 1_000_000:
    print(x)
    #sets new value to x ** 2 before loop continues
    x = x ** 2


# Write a loop that uses print to create the output shown below.
# 
# 
# 100
# 95
# 90
# 85
# 80
# 75
# 70
# 65
# 60
# 55
# 50

x = 100

#ends at 5
while x <= 100 and x >= 5:
    print(x)
    #increments by negative 5
    x -= 5


# ### For Loops

# Write some code that prompts the user for a number, then shows a multiplication table up through 10 for that number.
# 
# For example, if the user enters 7, your program should output:
# 
# 
# 7 x 1 = 7
# 7 x 2 = 14
# 7 x 3 = 21
# 7 x 4 = 28
# 7 x 5 = 35
# 7 x 6 = 42
# 7 x 7 = 49
# 7 x 8 = 56
# 7 x 9 = 63
# 7 x 10 = 70
# 

# In[11]:

print('Question 9')
print('This code creates a multiplication table of your number from 1 to 10.')
#user input for number variable
num = input("Enter a number: ")

#multiplication table starts at 1
count = 1

#ends at 10
while count <= 10:
    
    #product of multiplying at each loop... 7 x 1, 7 x 2, etc.
    result = int(num) * count
    
    #string formatting to print num variable with count of loop and result
    print(f'{num} x {count} = {result}')
    count += 1


# Create a for loop that uses print to create the output shown below.
# 
# 
# 1
# 22
# 333
# 4444
# 55555
# 666666
# 7777777
# 88888888
# 999999999
# 

# In[2]:

print('Question 10')
print('This code prints 1 through 9 times itself.')
#for loop of range 1, 10
for i in range(10):
    #prints string times loop index
    print(str(i) * i)


# ### Break and continue

# Prompt the user for an odd number between 1 and 50. Use a loop and a break statement to continue prompting the user if they enter invalid input. (Hint: use the isdigit method on strings to determine this). Use a loop and the continue statement to output all the odd numbers between 1 and 50, except for the number the user entered.
# 
# Your output should look like this:
# 
# 
# Number to skip is: 27
# 
# Here is an odd number: 1
# Here is an odd number: 3
# Here is an odd number: 5
# Here is an odd number: 7

# # Fizzbuzz

# One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to test basic looping and conditional logic skills.
# 
# - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# - For the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
